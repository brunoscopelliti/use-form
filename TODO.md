# TODOs

* [ ] Form validation, and submit handling. (Base functionality).

      - [ ] Radio buttons, and checkboxs group work a bit differently;
            In particular checkboxs group could have more than one value,
            eg. What do you like: [] pizza [] ice-cream [] hamburger ..

      - [ ] Form fields might have an initial value

      - [ ] Different validations

            - [ ] date
            - [ ] format
            - [ ] max-length
            - [ ] min-length
            - [ ] one-of
            - [ ] range
            - [ ] range-date
            - [ ] required

            - [ ] all the above could be applied condionally,
                  depending on the current state of the form;
                  eg. field B must have min-length 4, only if
                  field A is set.

      - [ ] Possibility to extend built-in validations

* [ ] The content of the form changes dinamically depending on the 
      user's interaction with the form itself.

* [ ] Reset button
